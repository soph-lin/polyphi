* Line break. Set the size of the line break (Highlight two or more lines, start and end highlighted lines will determine how big the line break is).
* Indent. Set the size of the indent. (Highlight one indented line)
* Block: Set a custom stanza/paragraph. (Highlight all the line(s) part of that stanza/paragraph)

* Ignore page numbers: For when submission has page numbers. (Don't want to count that as a stanza/paragraph!)
* Ignore first line: For when title is the first line. (Not really a stanza/paragraph yet!)
